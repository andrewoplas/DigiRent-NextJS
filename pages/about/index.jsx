              <span className="text-primary">Digi Rent</span> is built on innovation. When we
              started, we boosted the Dutch Rental platforms industry by introducing safer
              transactions in an unclear market. We offer an easier, transparent, cheaper and more
              flexible way than what the bulky, conventional market could deliver. We are still
              boosting innovation and are still working hard to make the rental market transparent
              than ever before by using digitalization as a form to bring down cost for all parties.
              Why don&apos;t use technology where it&apos;s intended for, to make our life easier
              and with less costs!
